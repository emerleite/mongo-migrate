MongoDB migrate
===============
This project aims to be an agnostic migration system for mongodb. Sometimes when you add attributes, you need to give a value for existing documents. Doing this frequently, this tool can help, since it has an  straightforward syntax and simplicity.

Dependencies
------------
MongoDB client - the bin file that comes with mongodb. I will soon create an installation script to make things easier. For now you need to download it from mongodb website. - <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>

Instalation
-----------
    $ git clone git://github.com/emerleite/mongo-migrate.git
    $ cd mongo-migrate
    $ cp config-sample.cfg config.cfg
    
Edit config.cfg with your database information

Usage
-----
Mongo migrate has two options. `generate` and `run`. The syntax is pretty straitforward as explained above:

### Basic information
By convention, mongo migrate uses the directory db/migrate when generating and running migrations. You can change it, by editing the MIGRATION_DIR configuration at config.cfg. See config.example.cfg for details.

### Generate
Mongo migrate generates migrtion in the following format: 

YYYMMDDhhmmssmm_name.js. Ex: 20111209002426_add_person.js

    $ ./mongo_migrate generate [name]

This will generate the following file:

```js
var migration = {
  up: function() {
  
  },
  down: function() {

  }
};

migration[target].call();
```

Put the code for the changes on up and the code for rollback on down.

### Running
Mongo migrate has 2 modes of running. Up and Down. The first make things happen and the second is a rollback. For these 2 modes, we call run one specific migration or all migrations. Mongo migrate controll the current migration, to enable run only the last migrations or just run all.

### One migration
    $ ./mongo_migrate run [name] up
    $ ./mongo_migrate run [name] down

The name can bem the full name or partial name. Ex: 20111209002426_add_person.js or only add_person. Mongo migrate will first look for a full name and after will fallback to find the file based on the partial name.

### All migrations
    $ ./mongo_migrate runall up
    $ ./mongo_migrate runall down

When running all migrations, mongo migrate will run only the new migrations, because it controls witch is the last one.
